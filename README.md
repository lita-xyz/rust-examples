# Rust-Examples

**ATTENTION: This repository is archived. For the latest versions of these examples, please see [the latest release bundle for the Valida toolchain](https://github.com/lita-xyz/valida-releases/releases).

## General Description

This project is a collection of various applications built using the Valida framework, which allows for the execution of Rust code with proofs of correctness. Each application serves as a template for demonstrating different functionalities, from simple calculations to more complex algorithms like Conway's Game of Life. The goal of this project is to provide a set of examples that can be used as a foundation for developing more advanced applications while ensuring correctness through formal verification.

This documentation provides an overview of the various projects in this directory, along with links to their respective README files for detailed instructions and usage.
